# BasicCMS

In this project, I'm creating a basic content management system to polish my back-end skills.

For the first leg of the project, I'm using ONLY vanilla CSS3 to create a basic responsive layout. Once authentication features have been added, I'll rework the app's front-end using Angular.js and change back-end parts as necessary.

Although this isn't efficient for a real product, I'm doing this to improve my fundamental CSS3 skills before going back to frameworks like Angular, Bootstrap, Vue, and React.

Technologies used:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Express / EJS
* MongoDB / Mongoose
* Heroku
